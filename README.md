Lijing Wang, David Zhen Yin, Jef Caers, Cambridge University Press, 2023

This repository includes
1. supplementary python jupyter notebooks for this textbook, organzied by each chapter
2. supplementary homework jupyter notebooks for the homework in the textbook
3. public geoscientific datasets: all our python practices are based on geoscientific real case studies

We hope this repository will help students to learn from practice and liberate students from any hard python coding.
